    "dAIsy21 offers a solution for Casino table  lovers to compete solo or with other players in real time against ”dAIsy”, the Artificial Intelligence house dealer.  The Goal of dAIsy21 would be along the lines of having a fair match, with counting cards out the question, and less public aggression/ anxiety,  because the only input that matters on the players behalf is how much they want to bid , stake and an Ethereum wallet address/private keys.<br><br> “dAIsy” will deal the hand dealt and the game can last 10 seconds to >20 minutes depending on the state of the current game. \n",
    "How Does it work?<br><br>\n",
    "There will be a maximum of 5 players which will be able to bid/stake however much they feel necessary. The payout will be based on the current payout structure of blackjack but with an incentive of this game being a quick,  low cost method of different classes i.e. less amount to bid and more expensive to bid for entering the house.<br><br> Also other than going to a casino and enduring that which can be a painful experience, dAIsy21 brings gambling to the safety and comfort of a players home. \n",
    "The exchanges are going through the players ETH wallets so each transaction will be verified on the blockchain as well as every win/loss will be served on its own network via IPFS. <br><br>Being the protocol is based on ETH, you will be able to play with people across the globe while at a cafe, on a plane (depending on how the Ethereum Satellite plays out November 20,2020, or just at a get together in your kitchen.\n",

    "Honestly I have no idea or do I care but most likely they will hate themselves if they haven’t already started implementing this and it’s their own fault.  I see this as a way for gambling to change the way it can be operated, and dAIsy21 is one of many steps to being one of the first scalable low-level decentralized social apps for the interplanetary gambling market for games likes Craps, Blackjack,War, etc..\n",
