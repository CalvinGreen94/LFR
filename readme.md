dAIsy21 - (Non-deterministic/deterministic  hybrid AI systems) 
Compete with real ETH against “dAIsy”, the AI blackjack dealer


What/Who is dAIsy21?
dAIsy21 offers a solution for Casino table  lovers to compete solo or with other players in real time against ”dAIsy”, the Artificial Intelligence house dealer.  The Goal of dAIsy21 would be along the lines of having a fair match, with counting cards out the question, and less public aggression/ anxiety,  because the only input that matters on the players behalf is how much they want to bid , stake and an Ethereum wallet address/private keys. “dAIsy” will deal the hand dealt and the game can last 10 seconds to >20 minutes depending on the state of the current game. 
How Does it work?
There will be a maximum of 5 players which will be able to bid/stake however much they feel necessary. The payout will be based on the current payout structure of blackjack but with an incentive of this game being a quick,  low cost method of different classes i.e. less amount to bid and more expensive to bid for entering the house. Also other than going to a casino and enduring that which can be a painful experience, dAIsy21 brings gambling to the safety and comfort of a players home. 
The exchanges are going through the players ETH wallets so each transaction will be verified on the blockchain as well as every win/loss will be served on its own network via IPFS. Being the protocol is based on ETH, you will be able to play with people across the globe while at a cafe, on a plane (depending on how the Ethereum Satellite plays out November 20,2020, or just at a get together in your kitchen.



Will casinos hate this concept? 
Honestly I have no idea or do I care but most likely they will hate themselves if they haven’t already started implementing this and it’s their own fault.  I see this as a way for gambling to change the way it can be operated, and dAIsy21 is one of many steps to being one of the first scalable low-level decentralized social apps for the interplanetary gambling market for games likes Craps, Blackjack,War, etc..

What will be the advantages of blockchain gambling: 
Blockchain is  basically unhackable, so the casino gets the highest level of financial security
Fast cross-border transactions without fees in the blockchain network 
Players have full ownership of their money, as this information is registered on the blockchain ledger. The data cannot be tampered with in any way
Playable money becomes liquid and easier to manage
Blockchain enables P2P transactions
Biometric security (enabled by a mobile app).
Players can be allowed to borrow money from other players. 
WebRTC communications
Use of various Cryptocurrency exchanges.. In this case Metamask
It’s fun and informational 
To run this Program: 
Install Ganache Client 
Install Ipfs Desktop (Windows , Mac, Linux) 
Once installed open Ganache and create an Ethereum environment for testnet 
Python Ver: 3.7.7 
Install requirements.txt file > pip install requirements.txt -r **WIP
Navigate to ../Lafranc/aiortc/DFproto/df 
Run python jacked.py  > install necessary dependencies (testnet)viaWeb3,Ganache or Metamask->Ropsten.. 
Ganache addresses can be used if you create a custom RPC host.
input ETH wallet addresses/private keys via Metamask or Ganache to house dealer, and players Address input via CoinbasePro API. Payouts will be in ETH but equal  to 1LaFranc Token. 
Get test Ethereum here if not using Ganache keys https://faucet.ropsten.be/
** Note: ANYONE CAN BE A HOUSE DEALER AND HAVE PLAYERS. But dAIsy is the main house,to borrow funds you will need to be connected to the official house. The house Holds the stake/collateral via Dai Maker protocol(WIP).

Players1-2 = MetaMask
Players3-5 = Ganache** Still Under Development**
